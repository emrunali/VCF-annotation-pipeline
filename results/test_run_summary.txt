Tools Used:
-----------
- SnpEff 2025-09-02 for functional annotation
- bcftools 1.22 for VCF manipulation
- Functional impact predictions based on Sequence Ontology terms

Clinical Relevance:
-------------------
HIGH impact variants are prioritized for clinical review as they typically
result in protein truncation or loss of function. MODERATE impact variants
(missense, in-frame indels) require further assessment based on:
  - Conservation scores (phyloP, phastCons)
  - Protein domain location and function
  - Population frequency (gnomAD MAF < 0.01)
  - Clinical databases (ClinVar pathogenic/likely pathogenic)
  - In silico predictions (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD)

Recommended Next Steps:
-----------------------
1. Review HIGH impact variants in disease-relevant genes
2. Filter by population frequency using gnomAD (MAF < 0.01)
3. Check ClinVar for known pathogenic variants
4. Assess MODERATE impact variants in candidate genes
5. Prioritize based on inheritance pattern and phenotype
6. Validate clinically significant variants via Sanger sequencing
